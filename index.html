        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I earned my degree from UPC - Barcelona Tech in <strong>2000</strong>
            but I began my career as <strong>Java</strong> developer at a local ISP a little earlier (in the late 1990s).
            We were among the first companies to use Java in Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <strong>2005</strong>, after a few years working as a developer,
            project manager and consultant I became dissatisfied with how software
            projects were being managed in the industry. Around this time I discovered
            the Agile Manifesto and I wanted to work for a company
            that followed its values. Since almost none existed in the Barcelona area, I
            co-founded <a href="https://www.agilogy.com">Agilogy</a>. I was also one of
            the founding member of the <strong>Agile Barcelona</strong> community.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several years of programming in Java, I felt it was not good
            enough to support the level of agility I sought. Following some experimentation
            with functional programming languages, in <strong>2012</strong> at Agilogy we
            adopted <strong>Scala</strong> as our default language for the next decade.
            Again, I was one of the founing member of the local <strong>Scala Barcelona</strong>
            community.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <strong>2020</strong>, when the pandemic struck, I felt it was time for a new era to begin.
            After a decade of focusing on the Scala programming language, I decided it was time to return to
            my roots and help companies become more agile regardless of the language they used.
            As of <strong>2025</strong>, I have been developing software with the .NET stack for a couple of years,
            and I still enjoy it as much as I did the first time.
