I haven been writing software since 1998 and involved in consulting and training since not much later.
In 2004 I co-founded Agilogy with the goal of creating a place to work according to the agile principles (of which I am a strong supporter).

Since then, I have worked with many teams (either as outsourcing or co-sourcing) some of them distributed across Europe in areas like e-commerce or social networks and lecturing in the university in areas related to software development.

These days I still spend most of my day writing software, front-end web apps with AngularJS and RESTful APIs using Scala technologies like Spray, Play or Slick.
